In order to build the OpenZoomSquared.fla in this directory to the desired
OpenZoomSquared.swf, you will need something that can compile ActionScript3.

You will also need to fetch the following library code into the org/, net/, 
and caurina/ subdirectories of your project.  You'll be wanting the ActionScript3 
(AS3) versions.


Library: OpenZoom SDK
Website: http://gasi.ch/blog/openzoom-sdk/
Source: http://github.com/openzoom/sdk/tree/master/src/org/
Target: ./org/

Library: GhostInteractive OpenZoom Overlay Extension
Website: http://labs.ghostinteractive.net/overlay-extension/ 
Source: http://code.google.com/p/ghostinteractive/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AS3/net
Target: ./net/

Library: Caurina Tweener
Website: http://code.google.com/p/tweener/
Source: http://code.google.com/p/tweener/source/browse/#svn/trunk/as3/caurina
Target: ./caurina/


(I've linked to a browsable place where you can see the directory of files you'll 
need, but you can download a zip of the SDK and pick the appropriate directory.)

Lastly, in order for you to actually run the viewer you will need to have the
data for the images and grid.  These are currently hardcoded as being found in
a directory found in the same location as the SWF called "allsquares".  The
proper data for this is produced by the generator which is written in Ruby and
included in the openzoom-squared project.
