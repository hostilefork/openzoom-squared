To run the ImaginationGenerator.rb script, you will need a Ruby environment that 
has been configured with the following library "gems":

	RMagick
	hpricot

You will also need to have the OpenZoom deep zooming file deepzoom.rb available:

	http://github.com/openzoom/deepzoom.rb

Note that depending on your system's performance and whether changes are
made to deepzoom.rb, you may need to modify it in order to put in some
destroy! calls.  See ImaginationGenerator.rb for details.  

(Better README to come, just trying to push this project out at the moment.)
